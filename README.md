### An Analysis of Loan Default Likelihood

**George Li**

#### Executive summary

#### Rationale
Fintechs are increasingly relying on data beyond just a credit score to make credit decisions. This is because the credit score alone may have biases toward certain demographics and also only provides a limited view of a person who may not have a long credit history. Predictions like this allow fintechs to seek more customers without running the risks of taking on too many customers with higher likelihoods of delinquency.
#### Research Question
What factors are more predictive of whether a person is going to be able to pay back a loan or default?
#### Data Sources
What data will you use to answer you question?

#### Methodology
Clustering Algorithms are necessary to determine the most significant features that contribute to whether someone defaults or not.

Classification algorithms to help predict whether someone defaults or not.

Hyperparams need to be tuned using grid search.
